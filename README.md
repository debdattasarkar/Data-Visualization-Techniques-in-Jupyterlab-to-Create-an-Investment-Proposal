# Data Visualization Techniques in Jupyterlab to Create an Investment Proposal
 Our team at City X has been tasked to analyze and highlight key data points to integrate with a presentation for a funding project. Your work will be to secure the grant to obtain funding for City X which will allow us to launch a bike-ride sharing network across the city. This is an initiative highly supported, but stakeholders would like to see key data points in order to allocate funding. As the Engineering Manager, I chose you to handle these tasks as you have shown great potential. You will need to examine two datasets and complete the related tasks so you can integrate the task data into our team report. You have the talent and skills to get this done and I would like to require that you use Python, Pandas and Plotly to complete the tasks.

Please check your sprint tasks for the week and see that you have been assigned a range of new tasks. These new tasks are focused on securing funding for City X, and using this funding to build a bike-sharing network city-wide. Please complete each task and attach the key data points or visualizations required. At the end of the tasks, the overall goal is to use the two datasets assigned to highlight the opportunity for revenue and other benefits.

# Lab scenario
In this lab, you work for a governmental organization as a Data Scientist. Right now, your organization is working to obtain funding for the new fiscal year to support investing funds into creating a bike sharing network across the city. In order to do so, you are tasked with creating visualizations using your Data Science and Visualization skills to support any findings that you have come across. In this scenario, your visualizations will be presented to the investment board meeting and are critical to proving the benefits and impact of bike sharing amongst the citizens of this city.

# Objectives
