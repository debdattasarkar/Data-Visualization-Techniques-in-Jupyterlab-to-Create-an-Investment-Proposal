In this lab, you work for a governmental organization as a Data Scientist. Right now, your organization is working to obtain funding for the new fiscal year to support investing funds into creating a bike sharing network across the city. In order to do so, you are tasked with creating visualizations using your Data Science and Visualization skills to support any findings that you have come across. In this scenario, your visualizations will be presented to the investment board meeting and are critical to proving the benefits and impact of bike sharing amongst the citizens of this city.
